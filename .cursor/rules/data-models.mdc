# data-models

## Core Data Structures

### Personality Evolution Model
- Tracks personality trait changes over time
- Maps life experience impacts to trait modifications
- Stores trauma markers and their cumulative effects
- Models attachment style variations
- Importance Score: 95/100

### Developmental Stage Schema
Path: backend/app/utils/developmental_stages.py
- Age-specific developmental milestone definitions
- Stage-based vulnerability multipliers
- Coping capacity thresholds per stage

### Therapy Modality Schema
Path: backend/app/utils/therapy_database.py
- Comprehensive therapy type definitions
- Symptom-to-therapy efficacy mappings
- Therapeutic mechanism specifications
- Treatment duration impact factors
- Importance Score: 80/100

## Relationships and Constraints

### Stage-Based Impact Correlations
- Maps developmental stages to trauma susceptibility

# data-models

Core Data Model Components:

## Personality Traits Model
Path: backend/app/services/psychology_engine.py
- Evolving personality trait attributes
- Impact multipliers for life experiences
- Trait modification tracking over time
- Cross-trait relationship mappings
Importance Score: 95/100

## Developmental Stage Schema
Path: backend/app/utils/developmental_stages.py
- Age-specific psychological vulnerability factors
- Stage-based trauma impact multipliers
- Developmental task requirements by age group
- Resilience factor definitions
- Coping capacity metrics
Importance Score: 85/100

## Therapeutic Intervention Model
Path: backend/app/utils/therapy_database.py
- Therapy modality profiles with effectiveness criteria
- Symptom-to-therapy mapping rules
- Duration and intensity parameters
- Outcome prediction metrics
- Contraindication flags
Importance Score: 80/100

## Cross-Model Relationships:
- Personality traits ↔ Developmental stages: Impact calculations
- Developmental stages ↔ Therapy types: Age-appropriate matching
- Therapy types ↔ Personality traits: Effectiveness predictions
- Symptoms ↔ All models: Severity tracking and progression

Key Constraints:
- Trait values must fall within evidence-based ranges
- Therapy matches require minimum age-appropriateness scores
- Impact multipliers scale based on developmental stage
- Symptom severity tracking requires consistent measurement criteria
