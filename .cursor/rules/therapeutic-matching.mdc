# therapeutic-matching

The therapeutic matching system consists of two core components that work together to evaluate and recommend optimal therapeutic interventions:

## Intervention Analysis Engine
Path: backend/app/services/intervention_engine.py
- Calculates therapy-symptom match scores based on presenting symptoms
- Evaluates duration impact on treatment effectiveness
- Generates evidence-based therapeutic recommendations
- Analyzes intervention efficacy using therapy database
Importance Score: 90/100

## Therapy Database
Path: backend/app/utils/therapy_database.py
- Maintains evidence-based therapy modalities with efficacy profiles
- Maps therapy types to optimal symptoms/conditions
- Defines treatment limitations and mechanisms of action
- Provides therapy match scoring algorithms
Importance Score: 85/100

## Key Matching Logic

### Efficacy Scoring
- Calculates match scores between therapy modalities and symptoms
- Considers age appropriateness of interventions
- Evaluates previous intervention history
- Determines sustained vs immediate therapeutic effects

### Treatment Optimization
- Identifies optimal therapy types for specific conditions
- Evaluates therapy duration requirements
- Considers contraindications and limitations
- Maps mechanisms of action to symptom profiles

# therapeutic-matching

The therapeutic matching system consists of two primary components that work together to match clients with optimal therapeutic interventions:

## Intervention Analysis Engine
Path: backend/app/services/intervention_engine.py
Importance Score: 90/100

Core Functions:
- Calculates therapy match scores by comparing client symptoms against therapy efficacy data
- Models projected treatment outcomes based on therapy duration
- Tracks ongoing symptom changes during therapeutic interventions
- Evaluates therapy efficacy considering client age and symptom presentation
- Generates analysis prompts specific to each therapy modality

## Evidence-Based Therapy Database
Path: backend/app/utils/therapy_database.py
Importance Score: 80/100

Core Functions:
- Maintains comprehensive mapping of therapy modalities and their documented efficacy rates
- Maps specific symptoms to their most effective therapeutic approaches
- Defines therapy-specific mechanisms of action and limitations
- Provides scoring framework for matching therapies to symptom presentations
- Supports evidence-based selection of intervention strategies

Key Matching Logic:
1. Symptom-based matching against therapy efficacy data
2. Age-appropriate intervention filtering
3. Treatment duration impact modeling
4. Ongoing efficacy tracking and adjustment
5. Therapy-specific outcome prediction

# therapeutic-matching

## Core Components

### Intervention Analysis Engine
Path: `backend/app/services/intervention_engine.py`
Importance Score: 90/100

- Calculates therapy match scores using evidence-based criteria
- Evaluates intervention efficacy based on symptom profiles and age factors
- Tracks therapeutic outcomes through symptom changes
- Models sustained effects and intervention limitations
- Considers developmental stage appropriateness for interventions

### Therapy Database System
Path: `backend/app/utils/therapy_database.py`
Importance Score: 80/100

- Maintains profiles of evidence-based therapy modalities
- Maps presenting symptoms to appropriate therapeutic approaches
- Calculates therapy-symptom compatibility scores
- Defines therapy duration and intensity requirements
- Models therapy limitations and effectiveness boundaries

## Match Scoring Logic

The therapeutic matching system implements:

1. Symptom-Based Mapping
- Direct correlation between symptom profiles and therapy modalities
- Evidence-based efficacy scoring for each symptom-therapy pair
- Consideration of symptom severity in match calculations

2. Age-Appropriate Filtering
- Developmental stage validation for intervention appropriateness
- Age-specific therapy modification requirements
- Adjustment of match scores based on developmental factors

3. Efficacy Prediction
- Calculation of expected intervention outcomes
- Tracking of symptom changes through therapeutic progression
- Modeling of sustained therapeutic effects
- Analysis of intervention limitations

4. Outcome Monitoring
- Therapeutic progress tracking
- Symptom severity change documentation
- Personality trait evolution monitoring
- Cross-experience trigger analysis
