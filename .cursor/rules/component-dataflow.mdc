Primary Data Flow Channels:

1. Experience Analysis → Developmental Impact
- Psychology Engine (psychology_engine.py) sends experience data to Developmental Engine
- Developmental stages.py applies age-specific trauma multipliers (1.0-1.8x)
- Returns modified impact scores based on developmental stage

2. Symptom → Therapy Matching
- Experience Analysis Engine evaluates symptom development
- Therapy Database (therapy_database.py) processes symptom profiles
- Intervention Engine calculates therapy-symptom match scores
- Returns prioritized therapeutic recommendations

3. Personality Evolution Pipeline
- Psychology Engine tracks personality trait changes
- Sends trait modifications to Developmental Engine for age-context
- Intervention Engine receives personality snapshots
- Returns calibrated therapeutic approaches

Core Integration Points:

1. Developmental Psychology → Intervention
```
developmental_stages.py → intervention_engine.py
- Age-appropriate intervention mappings
- Developmental stage context
- Coping capacity evaluations
```

2. Experience Analysis → Therapy Database
```
psychology_engine.py → therapy_database.py
- Symptom severity metrics
- Personality trait changes
- Trauma markers
```

3. Therapy Database → Intervention Engine
```
therapy_database.py → intervention_engine.py
- Therapy modality profiles
- Efficacy scoring
- Treatment limitations
```

# component-dataflow

Primary Data Flow Paths:

1. Psychology Engine → Developmental Framework
- Sends life experience data for age-specific impact analysis
- Receives trauma impact multipliers and developmental context
- Integrates developmental stage data into personality evolution calculations
Importance Score: 95/100

2. Psychology Engine → Intervention Engine
- Transmits current psychological state and symptom profiles
- Receives recommended therapeutic approaches and efficacy scores
- Exchanges trauma marker data for intervention matching
Importance Score: 90/100

3. Intervention Engine → Therapy Database
- Queries therapy modalities based on symptom patterns
- Retrieves evidence-based efficacy data for interventions
- Receives therapy-specific limitations and mechanisms
Importance Score: 85/100

4. Developmental Framework → Therapy Database
- Maps age-appropriate interventions to developmental stages
- Validates therapeutic approaches against developmental capacities
- Exchanges stage-specific therapy limitations
Importance Score: 80/100

Core Data Exchange Objects:

1. Psychological State Object
- Personality trait vectors
- Active trauma markers
- Current symptom profiles
- Attachment style indicators

2. Therapeutic Response Object
- Matched therapy modalities
- Efficacy predictions
- Duration estimates
- Stage-appropriate modifications

3. Developmental Context Object
- Current stage parameters
- Vulnerability multipliers
- Coping capacity metrics
- Age-specific risk factors
