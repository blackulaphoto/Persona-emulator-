## Core Psychological Calculations

The psychological evolution engine implements these key algorithms:

1. Trauma Impact Calculation
```
impact = base_trauma_severity * developmental_stage_multiplier
```
- Multipliers vary by developmental stage
- Higher multipliers during critical periods
- Compounds with existing trauma markers

2. Personality Trait Evolution
- Tracks changes across major personality dimensions
- Weights life experiences by developmental significance
- Calculates cumulative impact on trait stability
- Models attachment style modifications

3. Symptom Development Formula
```
symptom_severity = trauma_impact * vulnerability_factor * (1 - coping_capacity)
```
- Vulnerability derived from developmental stage
- Coping capacity scales with age/development
- Cross-references trigger patterns

## Development-Stage Processing

Located in `backend/app/utils/developmental_stages.py`:

1. Stage-Specific Multipliers:
- Early childhood: 2.0-3.0x
- Middle childhood: 1.5-2.0x
- Adolescence: 1.3-1.8x
- Adult: 1.0-1.5x

2. Coping Capacity Calculation
```
coping_capacity = base_capacity * developmental_stage_modifier
```
- Base capacity increases with age
- Modified by developmental achievements
- Adjusted for trauma history

3. Vulnerability Assessment
- Maps age to developmental vulnerabilities
- Calculates risk factors per stage
- Tracks cumulative vulnerability scores

## Implementation Notes

- Algorithms calibrated using developmental psychology principles
- Impact calculations factor in timing and severity
- Stage transitions handled via interpolation
- Trauma markers persist across developmental stages
- Attachment patterns influence personality evolution
