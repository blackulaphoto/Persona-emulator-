## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements advanced psychological analysis and therapeutic intervention modeling through four core components:

## Core Components Architecture

1. Developmental Psychology Engine (Importance: 95/100)
- Central age-based trauma impact calculator
- Developmental stage vulnerability mapping
- Trauma multiplier system (1.0-1.8x range)
- Stage-specific intervention matching

2. Therapy Efficacy Analysis (Importance: 90/100)
- Therapeutic intervention matching system
- Treatment duration impact modeling
- Evidence-based recommendation generator

3. Experience Analysis Engine (Importance: 90/100)
- Psychological impact calculator
- Personality trait evolution tracker
- Symptom development analyzer
- Developmental context integrator

4. Therapy Database (Importance: 85/100)
- Evidence-based modality definitions
- Symptom-therapy matching system
- Treatment limitation tracking
- Efficacy profile management

## Domain-Specific Systems

### Personality Evolution System

The system implements psychological development modeling through four interconnected core components:

## Psychological Evolution Engine
Location: backend/app/services/psychology_engine.py
Importance: 95/100

Central engine for personality evolution analysis and trauma impact assessment:
- Tracks personality trait changes over time
- Calculates experience impacts using developmental multipliers
- Analyzes symptom progression patterns
- Maps cross-experience trigger relationships

## Therapeutic Intervention Analysis
Location: backend/app/services/intervention_engine.py
Importance: 90/100

Evaluates and matches therapeutic approaches:
- Determines therapy efficacy based on age and symptoms
- Generates therapy match scores using evidence-based criteria
- Models intervention outcomes and limitations
- Tracks personality changes from therapeutic interventions

## Developmental Psychology Framework
Location: backend/app/utils/developmental_stages.py
Importance: 85/100

Age-specific psychological modeling:
- Defines developmental vulnerability factors
- Implements stage-specific trauma impact calculations
- Models age-appropriate coping mechanisms
- Maps developmental tasks and resilience factors

## Therapy Database & Matching
Location: backend/app/utils/therapy_database.py
Importance: 80/100

Evidence-based therapy matching system:
- Maintains therapy modality profiles
- Maps symptoms to therapeutic approaches
- Calculates intervention appropriateness scores
- Tracks required therapy duration and intensity

The system integrates these components to provide comprehensive psychological development simulation, combining developmental psychology principles with trauma theory and therapeutic intervention modeling.
